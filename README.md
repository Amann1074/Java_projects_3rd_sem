Shape Area and Volume Calculator
Overview
This Java program provides a menu-driven interface for calculating the area and volume of various geometric shapes, including Circle, Rectangle, Square, Sphere, Cylinder, and Equilateral Pyramid. The program is designed using object-oriented principles, utilizing abstract classes and interfaces to promote code reusability and maintainability.

Features
Calculate the area and perimeter of 2D shapes: Circle, Rectangle, and Square.
Calculate the surface area and volume of 3D shapes: Sphere, Cylinder, and Equilateral Pyramid.
User-friendly menu interface for easy navigation.
Input validation for shape dimensions.
Classes and Structure
The program consists of the following classes and interfaces:

Shape (Abstract Class): Base class for all shapes, containing methods for calculating area and perimeter.
Volume (Interface): Interface for calculating volume, implemented by 3D shapes.
Circle: Class for calculating the area and perimeter of a circle.
Rectangle: Class for calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
Square: Class for calculating the area and perimeter of a square.
Sphere: Class for calculating the surface area and volume of a sphere.
Cylinder: Class for calculating the surface area and volume of a cylinder.
EquilateralPyramid: Class for calculating the surface area and volume of an equilateral pyramid.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
